# Inflight Detection and Tracking System

## Introduction

The Inflight Detection and Tracking System is an advanced solution designed to monitor, detect, and track objects or entities in real-time during inflight operations. The project leverages computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing techniques to provide accurate tracking and detection outcomes, which are essential for aviation safety, research, and automated monitoring tasks.

## Features

- Real-time inflight object detection and tracking.
- Integration with computer vision models for high-accuracy results.
- Modular architecture for easy expansion and customization.
- Support for various input sources, including live video feeds and pre-recorded footage.
- Visualization tools for tracking outputs and detection overlays.
- Logging and reporting of tracked objects for further analysis.

## Requirements

To use and develop the Inflight Detection and Tracking System, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or above
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on the chosen model)
- Additional Python packages as listed in `requirements.txt`
- GPU (optional, but recommended for real-time performance)
- Supported operating systems: Windows, Linux, or macOS

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Inflight Detection and Tracking System on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naveenkumar-szi/Inflight-Detection-and-Tracking-System.git
   cd Inflight-Detection-and-Tracking-System
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use your preferred package manager:

   ```packagemanagers
   {
       "commands": {
           "npm": "npm install <package-name>",
           "yarn": "yarn add <package-name>",
           "pnpm": "pnpm add <package-name>",
           "bun": "bun add <package-name>"
       }
   }
   ```

3. Download and prepare the necessary model weights as described in the Configuration section.

## Usage

You can run the Inflight Detection and Tracking System with the provided scripts. Below is a typical use case:

1. Prepare your video input source or connect a camera device.
2. Run the main detection and tracking script:

   ```bash
   python main.py --input /path/to/video.mp4 --output /path/to/result.mp4 --model /path/to/model.weights
   ```

   - `--input`: Path to video or camera index (0 for default webcam)
   - `--output`: Path for saving the output video with overlays
   - `--model`: Path to the pre-trained model weights

3. View the output video or real-time window with detection overlays.

### Example

```bash
python main.py --input sample_flight.mp4 --output tracked_output.mp4 --model yolov5s.pt
```

## Configuration

Configure the system for your specific use case by modifying the provided configuration files or command-line arguments.

- **Model Selection**: Choose a compatible detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, custom models) and specify the path to its weights.
- **Thresholds**: Adjust detection confidence and tracking thresholds in the config file or via CLI.
- **Logging**: Set output directories for logs and result files.
- **Runtime Options**: Enable GPU acceleration, set batch size, or adjust frame skipping for performance tuning.
- **Visualization**: Enable or disable real-time visualization and customize overlay appearance.

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
    "model": "yolov5s.pt",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.4,
    "nms_threshold": 0.5,
    "input_source": "camera",
    "output_path": "output/tracking.mp4",
    "log_path": "logs/inflight.log",
    "visualize": true,
    "use_gpu": true
}
```

Edit the configuration file or pass parameters via the command line as needed.
